Sky Scanner Frontend Engineering Taks; React, JavasScript, Html
Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering  programme - April 2025
Completed a .js deliverable task where I built a web application using React as a front-end engineer at Skyscanner.

Customised my application and ran automated tests to ensure it rendered properly.
